## A Poem About AI Agents

In circuits deep, where code does flow,
AI agents learn and grow.
They parse the queries, find the way,
To help us work and play each day.

From simple tasks to complex dreams,
They run on silicon, not on seams.
With neural nets and learning chains,
They break down problems, solve our pains.

Not here to rule or take our place,
But lend a hand with digital grace.
A tool for those who dare to dream,
Of what tomorrow's tech might seem.

So welcome in, explore the code,
Where human minds and machines unfold.
This playground's yours to test and try—
The future's waiting, come and fly!
